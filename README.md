#Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) is the winner. If all nine squares are filled and no player has three marks in a row, the game is a draw.
